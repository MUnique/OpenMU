/// You may wonder where the Id is. The original server and this <see cref="IGuildServer"/> uses an integer id for guilds, too.
/// I decided to manage these keys in memory and on demand, they are not persistent.
/// I could've used an integer Id as primary key in the persistent Guild class, but don't do it by purpose:
/// We would lose the ability to easily merge two databases (realms), if we do that. Even if we use a separate integer id column in the database,
/// it needs to be re-assigned after a merge.
