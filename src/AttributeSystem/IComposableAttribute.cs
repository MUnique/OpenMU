/// The Attribute... Hint: every attribute could be wrapped into an element to chain them.
/// Example: We have a base strength attribute which could be wrapped into an element,
///          and this element could be added to a total strength attribute, which will
///          also contain the elements gotten from master tree or ancient items.
///          This way we could identify the base stats, which are needed for the character stats packet.
///          Another use could define an aggregate function (either addition or multiplication), and again
///          we could chain this calculations together (keeping commutative property).
