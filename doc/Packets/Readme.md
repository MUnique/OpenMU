# Packet documentation #

In this folder you find the documentation of the packet messages which are getting exchanged between client and server. 

As stated in the project readme, the primary protocol is the ENG (english version) of Season 6 Episode 3.

There is one file for each packet. The packet documentation is generated through XSLT. The source XML files are at [MUnique.OpenMU.Network.Packets](../src/Network/Packets).

In case you want to contribute packet documentations, please extend these source files accordingly. If you want to build the markdown files as well (Windows only), you need to install Saxon HE 9.9N, and execute the ```GenerateMarkdownDocs.cmd```.

## Packet types

MU Online packets can start with four different byte values (0xC1 to 0xC4) which all have a different meaning. You can find a description [here](PacketTypes.md).
