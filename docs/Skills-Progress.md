# Progress of implemented Skills

I want to give a overview about which skills are already implemented and which
ones need some rework.

Some general notes:

* Elemental effects (poison, ice, etc.) are not yet implemented at all

* Area Damage Skills with explicit damage packets work, but are vulnerable to cheaters

* Area Damage Skills with implicit damage work, but directions are not
  considered yet - they hit targets in all directions.

* All kind of skills which are somehow special are not working
